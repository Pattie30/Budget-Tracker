The app is deployed in https://pcinsoftware.com
The idea for this project was a simple but very useful application that was properly centered and styled with bootstrap.
Will be working to incorporate further styles to the React Boostrap in the app since I learned it takes a little 
more to work with normal boostrap and css. 

Future Enhancements: 
(*) Add a timestamp to each of the expenses when they are added.
(*) Save the data that is entered.
(*) Create a user log in.
(*) Be able to use a background image along with react bootstrap.
